# requirements
keyboard at least 0.11.0

# tofo
want to do - activate shortcut - lists indices over all your currently tiled windows
hit index and switcheroo

so.. default add win to tile > can rearrange all at once
add "workspace" -> the partition gets its own tiling scheme

## mayb?
tabs w/in partitions

how do i do equal splits and constraints..
for 1st one i can handle it in tiling scheme

# gotta do
window dec is ugly for explorer wins :/

changing partition schemes on the fly / use an additional data attribute on nodes for tile scheme switch

more partition schemes..
multiple workspaces / auto setup of all that jazz

auto a e s t h e t i c ratios

# plan

promote to diff tile type
hmm.. promoting partitions to workspaces doesn't work the way i want it to..
too much duplication of code needed..
mayb some icon based scheme switcher? like a popup menu

win10 workspaces?
