plan

first virtualize.. as in just draw on a canvas where windows will go

get reliable win api hooking

binary tree partitioning

ability to have multiple workspaces w/in a partition
like say i have my desktop split in half and want to switch what's on the right half with something else

this means i need little tabs somewhere to keep track of what windows are where .-.

think... ~functional~
