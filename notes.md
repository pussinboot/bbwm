need to be able to switch the scheme on the fly, which means recomputing all spaces

so.. default add win to tile > can rearrange all at once
add "workspace" -> the partition gets its own tiling scheme

# mayb?
tabs w/in partitions

how do i do equal splits and constraints.. 
for 1st one i can handle it in tiling scheme

# gotta do
actual gui / window dec
manual horiz/vert splits
changing partition schemes on the fly / promoting partitions to workspaces
using gui to edit split ratio
more partition schemes..
