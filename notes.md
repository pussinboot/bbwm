## mayb?
tabs w/in partitions

how do i add constraints..

# gotta do
more partition schemes..

auto a e s t h e t i c ratios

# plan

popup menus for tile scheme / workspace / alt-tab replacement

# fix things

changing tiling scheme is hard to follow..
    need to highlight parent partitions when entering menu
doesn't retile them until i add another one
rotating horizontal tiling scheme works but then resets


move w mouse requires modifications to keep track of floating spaces
